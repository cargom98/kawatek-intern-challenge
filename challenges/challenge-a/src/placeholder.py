"""
Kawatek Internship Challenge A: EMG Signal Classification Pipeline
==================================================================

Your task is to build a signal processing and classification pipeline
that converts raw EMG signals into grip pattern predictions.

Start by implementing the functions below, then add your own logic.

Good luck!
